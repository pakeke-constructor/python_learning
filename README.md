# python_learning
These were all the projects I made when I first did python.
Am keeping them on github so I can come back to them sometime in future.
(Not all of them are functioning)

Noteable projects:

Showcase.py
(my first program)

Random planet generator.py
(final project for ara, my second program)

Ballz.py and The Battle of AGAR.py are probably the only good functioning ones other than that
